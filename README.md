# Puzzle App @UVA

The purpose of this application is to let users create and play puzzle hunts centered around UVA's grounds, 
in the vein of the 13 Society's annual scavenger hunt sent out via email. Our platform allows
users to play puzzle hunts by receiving a prompt, optionally reading hints, and selecting their 
guess on a map. The scores are determined via proximity, similar to GeoGuessr. Users can create their
own hunts and publish them for all to see, controlled by an administrator who can also leave feedback
for puzzle creators.
